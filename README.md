This project is a jumpstart kit for a Golang web apps.

To get going:

1- Clone the project.
	git clone https://github.com/ausrasul/goSkeleton.git

2- Update the start.sh file with the correct path to the project.

3- Source start.sh file to get the env variables for golang and beego.
	source ./start.sh

4- Install Beego.
	go get github.com/astaxie/beego
	

Ok, this repo works, but I'm still working on few things, many things will change so I will not write any documentation right now.
